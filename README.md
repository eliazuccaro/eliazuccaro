Hi, I'm Elia Zuccaro and welcome to my GitHub repository!

I got a bachelor degree in Information Engineering at University of Salento and I'm a Robotics and Automation Engineering student at University of Pisa.

Here you can find the projects I carried on in my university years, each one included with the code and a brief description.
