Hi, I'm Elia Zuccaro and welcome to my GitHub repository!

I got my bachelor degree in Information Engineering at the University of Salento and my Master's degree in Robotics and Automation Engineering at the University of Pisa.

Here you can find the projects I carried on in my university years, each one included with the code and a brief description.
